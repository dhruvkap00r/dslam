SLAM Algorightm:


Probabilistic SLAM:
  it gives the position or location of the robot and location of the landmarks, given all the actions taken by robot, observation and initial state.
  For all of this, we require a observation model and a state transition model.

Observation model:
  describe the probability of getting an observation Z(k) given the location X(k) and map.
    P(Z(k)|X(k), m)

Motion model:
  it gives probability destribution of state transition. It is a Markov process, probability of getting location X(k) depends on the previus location X(k-1) and action taken U(k).


While making observations,
it is hard to make correct decisions about landmark's locations, but we can get accurate location of a landmark relative to other landmark. 

P(M(i), M(j)) is higher than P(M(i)).

and it is proven that this probability monotonically increases.

** Every Landmark should be interlinked, so we can make observation and update their location,relativily, independent of our location.
